# 🎨Deckorator
  Deckorator is a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool that allows users to upload and process presentation files. It utilizes keyword-based search functionality to identify and extract relevant slides from the uploaded decks.
  ## ✨Features

  ✅ Upload any presentation file and search for content using embedded keywords.
  
  ✅ Keyword-based filtering: The tool identifies slides based on keywords that are embedded in white text within the deck.
  
  ✅ Selection and extraction: Users can select relevant slides and download them as a new presentation.
  
  ✅ Automated processing: The system processes slides efficiently to deliver accurate search results.
  
  ✅ Watermark removal: Ensures clean and professional output by eliminating unwanted watermarks.
  

  ## 🛠️How It Works

  2️⃣ Use the search bar to find relevant slides based on pre-embedded keywords.
